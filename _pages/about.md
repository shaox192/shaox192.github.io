Hey there! I'm a PhD student in the Department of Psychology and the Beckman Institute at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Professor [Diane M. Beck](https://psychology.illinois.edu/directory/profile/dmbeck). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology with minors in Statistics and Neuroscience from University of Minnesota Twin-Cities.

These days I'm working on 1. bridging human visual neuroscience and deep learning to build more robust, noise-resistant vision systems; 2. understanding how our brains predict what we'll see next and why human vision is so remarkably efficient.
