Hey there! I'm PhD student in the department of Psychology and the Beckman Institue at UIUC, advised by Professor Diane M. Beck. I'm also pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science here at UIUC. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology with minors in Statistics and Neuroscience from UMN. 

My research delves into the fascinating intersection of human visual neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I aim to understand how our visual system achieves object recognition invariance, allowing us to effortlessly navigate through diverse visual environments. This quest will help advancements in deep learning, particularly in enhancing model resilience against noise in visual tasks. We use fMRI, as well as ultra-high field (UHF) fMRI, to explore the human visual system and leveraging advanced deep learning models for the computational aspect. An additional focus of mine is on the predictive capabilities of the brain in scene perception and understanding visual phenomena like crowding through the lens of active inference.

Besides research, I dedicated myself to advocacy and education on critical social issues. As an advocate working at The Aurora Center for Advocacy and Education at UMN, I served for victims and survivors of sexual assault, stalking, and domestic violence. My role also involved coordinating outreach events and fostering collaborations with student organizations to encourage the conversation around womenâ€™s rights and empowerment.
